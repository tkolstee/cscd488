## Gameplay
Users can play as both a "red team" and a "blue team". They are the offensive and defensive side of cybersecurity, respectively. Teams can accumulate revenue and items to help them achieve their goals. Blue teams seek to protect themselves from attacking teams and learn the basics of defending against cyber attacks. Red teams must learn how attacks work and what items are needed to carry out attacks against other teams.
